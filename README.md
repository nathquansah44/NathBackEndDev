# 👋 Hi, I'm Nathaniel Quansah
### ⚖️ Lawyer turned Backend Software Developer | ALX Backend Program Learner


For years I interpreted laws, and now I interpret logic. My transition from legal practice to backend development comes from an endless curiosity about how things work beneath the surface. I’m passionate about solving real-world problems through code — especially where technology and ethics intersect.


I believe that strong systems, like strong laws, rely on structure, clarity, and fairness. At ALX, I’m learning to design reliable backend systems, automate processes, and build scalable applications that make an impact. My vision is to use technology to promote transparency and trust — one line of code at a time.
